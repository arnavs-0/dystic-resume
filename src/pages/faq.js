          This is aimed to be the world&apos;s simplest privacy policy. This
          document should explain to you why the app collects some information,
          what happens when your account is deleted and some other frequently
          asked questions answered regarding your privacy.

        <p className="mt-6 leading-loose">
          If you have any more questions, please raise an issue regarding the
          same on GitHub and I&apos;ll answer as honest and quickly as possible

          What identifiable information is stored about me?
        </h4>
        <p className="leading-loose">
          Your name and your email address is stored along with your user
          information, if you signed in with Google, and of course, all the
          information you input in your resume is also stored in the database.
          You won&apos;t even get any marketing emails, feature updates,
          newsletters, notification emails, nothing.

          Why are you using a database, why not keep everything local like in
          the first version of Reactive Resume?
        </h4>
        <p className="leading-loose">
          Not having a centralized database cause a lot more problems than I
          could solve, mainly having a large chunk of the users of the app
          having an outdated schema as the app evolved. This was a problem I
          could not solve without having at least some control.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-6 leading-loose">
          Also, a lot of users were having trouble printing their resumes on
          their browsers, so with the help of Cloud Functions from Firebase, you
          can now print your resumes remotely. None of the resumes are stored,
          and they are sent to you immediately after generation, which can be
          verified by looking through the source code.

          How is this all free? There must be a catch!
        </h4>
        <p className="leading-loose">
          <strong>Absolutely no catch to this freebie.</strong> This project is
          just my way of giving back to the community that I&apos;ve learned so
          much from. If you&apos;d like to show your appreciation however, you
          can follow me on my social media and let me know how much it helped
          you, or donate to help pay the cloud bills, or if you are a fellow
          developer, you can head to GitHub and contribute to the code and
          raising a PR.

          Is there a mobile app for Reactive Resume?
        </h4>
        <p className="leading-loose">
          <strong>Not yet. But soon, maybe?</strong> One of the main motivations
          for me to shift to a centralized database approach was that I could
          one day build a mobile app as well that could let users jump from
          editing on their desktops to editing on their phones. It requires a
          lot of time, so I would not expect it any time soon, but it&apos;s
          definitely in the pipeline.
